# Simple Calculator

## Project Description  
This is a basic console-based Simple Calculator implemented in Java. It performs fundamental arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project demonstrates key programming concepts including decision making with if-else and switch-case statements, modular programming with methods, and handling user input via the console. It is intended as a beginner-level project to strengthen understanding of core Java programming concepts.

## Concepts Used  
- If-else statements  
- Switch-case statements  
- Methods/Functions  
- Input handling with Scanner  
- Basic error checking (e.g., division by zero)  

## Features  
- Perform arithmetic operations on two numbers: add, subtract, multiply, divide.  
- User-friendly menu-driven interface for operation selection.  
- Validates division to prevent divide-by-zero errors.  

## Installation  
1. Download the source code files: `Calculator.java` and `CalculatorApp.java`.  
2. Open terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder containing these files.  
3. Compile the code using:  
   ```
   javac Calculator.java CalculatorApp.java
   ```
4. Run the application with:  
   ```
   java CalculatorApp
   ```

## Usage  
- When prompted, enter the number corresponding to the desired arithmetic operation.  
- Enter the two numbers on which the operation should be performed.  
- View the output result displayed on the console.  

## Contributing  
Contributions such as adding more operations (power, modulus, square root), improving error handling, or creating a graphical user interface are welcome.
