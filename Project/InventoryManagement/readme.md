# Inventory Management System (Basic)

## Project Description
This Java console-based Inventory Management System manages product stocks with basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It uses Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, arrays (using ArrayList), loops, and conditional statements to simulate a real-world inventory system. The project helps learners understand managing collections of objects and implementing basic user interaction in Java.

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Arrays and ArrayList collections
- Loops for iteration
- Conditional statements
- Basic input/output operations

## Features
- Add new products with ID, name, and quantity
- View all products in inventory
- Update quantity of existing products
- Remove products from inventory
- Search for products by ID

## Installation
1. Download the following Java source files:
    - `Product.java`
    - `Inventory.java`
    - `InventoryManager.java`
    - `InventoryManagementApp.java`
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the folder containing these files.
3. Compile all Java files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the main application:
   ```
   java InventoryManagementApp
   ```

## Usage
- Follow onscreen menu prompts to perform inventory operations.
- Use product IDs carefully to retrieve or modify specific records.
- Exit the program through the menu when finished.

## Contributing
Contributions to enhance the project with features such as persistent data storage, multi-user support, or GUI are welcome.
