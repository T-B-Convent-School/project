# Student Grade Calculator

## Project Description
This Java program calculates student grades through a modular, object-oriented design using multiple classes. It accepts marks for multiple subjects, calculates the percentage, and assigns grades based on conditional logic. The project demonstrates arrays, loops, conditionals, and basic class structures.

## Files and Responsibilities
- `Student.java` - Represents a student with name, marks, percentage, and grade calculation logic.
- `StudentManager.java` - Manages a collection of Student objects.
- `GradeCalculator.java` (optional) - Contains static methods for grade determination.
- `StudentInput.java` - Handles user input for students and their marks.
- `StudentGradeApp.java` - Main application class coordinating input, calculation, and output.

## Concepts Used
- Arrays for storing marks
- Loops for input collection and processing
- Conditionals for grade assignment
- Classes and method encapsulation
- Basic Input/Output via console

## How to Run
1. Download all the `.java` files.
2. Compile all files together:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the main application:
   ```
   java StudentGradeApp
   ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter student name, number of subjects, and marks for each subject.
5. View the calculated percentage and grade output.

## Usage Example
```
Enter student name: Anjali Gill
Enter number of subjects: 3
Enter marks for subject 1: 85
Enter marks for subject 2: 92
Enter marks for subject 3: 78

Student: Anjali Gill
Percentage: 85.00%
Grade: B
```
