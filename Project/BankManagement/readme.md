# Bank Management System (Basic)

## Project Description
This Java-based Bank Management System simulates real-world banking operations including creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and displaying account information. Using classes, objects, switch-case statements, and loops, the project provides a menu-driven console interface to interact with multiple bank accounts. This project demonstrates fundamental Object-Oriented Programming principles with practical application.

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Switch-case statements for menu-driven control
- Loops for repeated interaction
- Basic input/output with Scanner
- Encapsulation and method usage

## Features
- Create new bank accounts with account number, holder name, and initial balance
- Deposit funds into an account
- Withdraw funds from an account checking for sufficient balance
- Display details of all accounts
- User-friendly menu for easy navigation

## Installation
1. Download the following Java source files:
    - `Account.java`
    - `Bank.java`
    - `Transaction.java`
    - `UserInterface.java`
    - `BankManagementApp.java`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the files.
3. Compile all Java files:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the main application:
   ```
   java BankManagementApp
   ```

## Usage
- Use the displayed menu options to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, display accounts, or exit.
- Enter requested data such as account numbers, holder names, and transaction amounts when prompted.
- The program validates transactions for sufficient balance and displays appropriate messages.

## Contributing
Enhancements like adding transaction history, user authentication, file/database persistence, or a GUI interface are encouraged.
