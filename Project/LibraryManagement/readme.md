# Mini Library Management System

## Project Description
This Java console application simulates a simple library management system demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, and method encapsulation. The system manages a collection of books and registered students, allowing operations such as adding books/students, issuing and returning books, and displaying inventories. This project is useful for learning essential programming and software design principles.

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Arrays and ArrayList Collections
- Methods and Encapsulation
- Input/Output handling via Scanner
- Basic control structures (loops, conditionals)

## Features
- Add and view library books with details and stock management
- Register students and maintain student records
- Issue books to registered students if available
- Return books and update library inventory
- Menu-driven user interface for easy interaction

## Installation
1. Download these Java source code files:
    - `Book.java`
    - `BooksCollection.java`
    - `Student.java`
    - `StudentsCollection.java`
    - `LibraryManagementApp.java`
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory with these files.
3. Compile all files together:
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the application main class:
   ```
   java LibraryManagementApp
   ```

## Usage
- Follow on-screen menu prompts to add, list, issue, and return books or students.
- Enter IDs carefully to operate on existing records.
- Exit the program from the menu when done.

## Contributing
